# Fast food toilet code registration web application
As part of my university semester project, I developed an extended CRUD application with user authentication and authorization, where users can record WC codes with pictures of the restaurant, write reviews and ratings.

## BackEnd
C# ASP.NET Core Web APi. Run the application and the swagger site will open.

## FrontEnd
Angular project. Cd into the app folder and Run `npm install` then `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
